Hi, I’m Jordan—an end-to-end engineer who enjoys squeezing real products into tiny budgets. Most days you’ll find me wiring together Next.js front ends, resilient Node back ends, and the infrastructure footprints that keep them all affordable.

I write about the systems thinking that sits between code and hosting: why static exports belong on GitHub Pages, how to stretch EC2 micro instances without fighting RAM, and when to fall back to a home lab with a Cloudflare Tunnel. Every article is pulled from something I’ve shipped for myself or a client.

When I’m not tuning deployments, I’m usually experimenting with side projects, building out observability dashboards, or sketching the next hybrid architecture on paper before touching a terminal. If you’d like to collaborate or compare notes, feel free to reach out—always happy to chat.
